2d breakout game

  As of today HTML canvas is something I found quite confusing. While googling different articles to understand drawing and animation I stumebled across this link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript. I decided to go through the tutorial. For now, I'm happy with this project....but I'll be sure to revisit it sometime to add a few things here and there.
